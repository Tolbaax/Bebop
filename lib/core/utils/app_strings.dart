      '1. Place the baby on his/her back to sleep to reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).'
      '\n\n2. Always use a safety-approved crib, playpen, or bassinet for sleep and play. Make sure the crib has a tight-fitting mattress and no loose or broken parts.'
      '\n\n3. Keep all objects, including toys, pillows, and loose bedding, out of the crib to prevent suffocation.'
      '\n\n4. Never leave a baby unattended on a changing table, bed, or any other high surface.'
      '\n\n5. Always use a safety belt when using a baby carrier or stroller.'
      '\n\n6. Keep small items, such as coins, pins, and batteries, out of reach of babies and young children, as they can be a choking hazard.'
      '\n\n7. Store cleaning products, medicines, and other hazardous substances out of reach and in a locked cabinet.'
      '\n\n8. Use safety gates at the top and bottom of stairs and use doorknob covers to prevent babies from accessing dangerous areas.'
      '\n\n9. Always supervise a baby when in or near water, including bathtubs, pools, and even buckets of water.'
      '\n\n10. Keep hot liquids, such as coffee and tea, away from babies and young children.'
      '\n\n11. Make sure your home is smoke-free to reduce the risk of fire and secondhand smoke.'
      '\n\n12. Consider installing smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors in your home for added safety.'
      '\n\nIt\'s important to always keep an eye on your baby and take necessary precautions to ensure their safety. By following these tips, you can create a safe and secure environment for your baby.';
  static const String tipDesc2 =
      '1. Meet their physical needs: Make sure your baby is fed, changed, and has a clean and dry diaper. A well-fed and comfortable baby will be more content and easier to soothe.'
      '\n\n2. Respond to their cries: Crying is a baby\'s primary way of communicating their needs, so it\'s important to respond promptly. Observe your baby\'s body language, tone of voice, and facial expressions to figure out what they need.'
      '\n\n3. Provide comfort: Comforting a baby can mean different things to different babies, but some common ways include holding them close, rocking, singing, or talking softly to them.'
      '\n\n4. Create a safe and secure environment: Babies feel safe when they have a secure base from which to explore their surroundings. A safe and secure environment can be created by placing your baby in a crib or bassinet with a firm and flat surface.'
      '\n\n5. Establish a routine: Babies thrive on routine and structure, so try to establish a predictable schedule for feedings, naps, and bedtime. This can help create a sense of security and comfort for your baby.'
      '\n\n6. Offer stimulation: Babies love to learn and explore, so make sure they have plenty of opportunities to do so. Offer toys that are appropriate for their age and development level, and encourage them to use their senses to experience the world around them.'
      '\n\n7. Respond to their emotions: Empathy is an important skill for parents to have when it comes to responding to their baby\'s needs. When a baby is upset, try to identify the source of their distress and offer comfort and support.'
      '\n\n Remember, every baby is unique and what works for one baby may not work for another. It\'s important to be patient and flexible as you figure out what your baby needs.';

  static const String tipDesc3 =
      '1. Choose the right time: Try to pick a time when your baby is relaxed and not too hungry or sleepy. Some parents find that bathing their baby before bedtime helps them wind down for the night.'
      '\n\n2. Gather your supplies: Make sure you have everything you need within reach, including a baby bathtub, towels, washcloths, baby soap, and a clean diaper.'
      '\n\n3. Fill the tub with warm water: The water should be warm but not hot, around 90-100°F. You can use a thermometer or test the water with your elbow to make sure it\'s not too hot.'
      '\n\n4. Support your baby\'s head and neck: When you place your baby in the tub, be sure to support their head and neck with one hand. Babies this age do not have good head control, so it\'s important to keep them safe and secure.'
      '\n\n5. Wash your baby gently: Use a baby soap or gentle wash to clean your baby\'s skin, making sure to clean all creases and folds. Pay special attention to areas like the neck, behind the ears, and the diaper area.'
      '\n\n6. Rinse thoroughly: Make sure to rinse your baby thoroughly to remove all soap and suds. Be careful to avoid getting soap or water in their eyes or nose.'
      '\n\n7. Wrap your baby in a towel: After the bath, wrap your baby in a warm, soft towel and dry them off thoroughly. Pay attention to their skin, especially in areas that tend to be moist, like the neck, behind the ears, and in the folds of their arms and legs.'
      '\n\n8. Dress your baby: Once your baby is dry, put on a clean diaper and dress them in warm, comfortable clothes.'
      '\n\n Remember, it\'s normal for newborns and young infants to only need a bath 2-3 times a week. Over-bathing can dry out their skin and strip it of its natural oils.';

  static const String tipDesc4 =
      '1. Place your baby on a firm, flat surface: A firm and flat sleep surface is the safest place for your baby to sleep. This could be a crib, bassinet, or playard that meets current safety standards.'
      '\n\n2. Place your baby on a firm, flat surface: A firm and flat sleep surface is the safest place for your baby to sleep. This could be a crib, bassinet, or playard that meets current safety standards.'
      '\n\n3. Keep the sleep area clear: Do not place any toys, loose bedding, or anything else in the sleep area with your baby. This can create a suffocation hazard.'
      '\n\n4. Place your baby on their back: Place your baby on their back to sleep, as this position has been shown to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).'
      '\n\n5. Avoid bed-sharing: Do not place your baby to sleep in an adult bed, as this can increase the risk of suffocation and other sleep-related dangers.'
      '\n\n6. Consider using a pacifier: Some research suggests that using a pacifier at naptime and bedtime may reduce the risk of SID. If you choose to use a pacifier, make sure it is not attached to the baby\'s clothing to prevent suffocation.'
      '\n\n7. Maintain a comfortable room temperature: Keep the room where your baby sleeps at a comfortable temperature, between 68-72°F. Overheating has been linked to an increased risk of SID, so it\'s important to keep the room cool but not too cold.'
      '\n\n8. Monitor your baby\'s movements: Regularly check on your baby while they sleep to make sure they are breathing comfortably and not in distress.'
      '\n\n By following these tips, you can create a safe sleep environment that reduces the risk of sleep-related dangers for your baby.';
